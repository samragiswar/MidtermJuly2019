Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or
other sets of instructions for computers to execute.



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.Java development kid.
1)The Java runtime interpreter (java) is a stand-alone version of the Java interpreter built into the HotJava browser.
The runtime interpreter provides the support to run Java executable programs in compiled, bytecode format.
2)The Java compiler (javac) is used to compile Java source code files into executable Java bytecode classes.
In Java, source code files have the extension .java.The Java compiler takes files with this extension and
generates executable class files with the .class extension.
3)he applet viewer is a tool that serves as a minimal test bed for final release Java applets. You can use the applet
 viewer to test your programs instead of having to wait for HotJava to support the final release of Java.
4)The Debugging is the process of fixing bugs or errors present in the code or a project. Debugging, in other words,
 improves the quality of the code.
5)The java  command disassembles one or more class files.
6)API is an application programming interface (API) presenting a set of definitions, communication protocols, and tools
for building software.




What is IDE?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
what is class?
blue print of an object

What is object?
object is an instance of class.

What is the entry point of an application?
The main method is the entry point of a Java application.

Why main is static?
Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without creating
an object of the class in which the main method is defined.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object is the super class of all other classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an
environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Interface has no defined methods while abstract is a hybrid class that can have abstract methods and also define
methods.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it?
No
these two classes used to declare and define methods.

what is Access Specifier?
Access specifiers are used to control the visibility of members like classes, variables and methods.
There are three access specifiers: public, private and protected.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
 Object Oriented Programming.They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Encapsulation means putting together all the variables (instance variables) and the methods into a single unit called
Class.

An important feature of object-oriented programs is inheritance—the ability to create classes that share the attributes
and methods of existing classes, but with more specific features. Inheritance is mainly used for code reusability.

Polymorphism is one of easy concept to understand. Polymorphism definition is that Poly means many and morphos means
forms. It describes the feature of languages that allows the same word or symbol to be interpreted correctly in
different situations based on the context.

All programming languages provide abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the problems you’re able to
solve is directly related to the kind and quality of abstraction.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. java.lang package is imported by default.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Application Programming Interface. We have used java API.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java does not support the multiple inheritance. instead it supports multi interfaces.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument
 lists are different.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.

If an exception has occurred, the method creates an Object known as Exception Object and hands it off to the run-time
system(JVM). The exception object contains name and description of the exception, and current state of the program where
 exception has occurred.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in java is used for memory management. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the
class variable.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final is a java keyword which makes the variable and methods not changeable.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't
be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Final is a keyword.

Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finally is a block.

Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. It is a method.


What is a constructor ?
n class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. I

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A class can have multiple constructors, as long as their signature (the parameters they take) are not the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
The default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
keyword that refers to the reference variable.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
It is a  keyword that calls the variables, constructor or methods from the child class to parent class.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
yes

What version of java are you using?
java 11.0.1

What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JVM is the machine while JDK is the whole java program.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE is the container, JVM is the content.

What is compile time and run time?
Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development.

What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
By collecting garbage once object are not in need anymore.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
s a sequence of characters that exist as an object of the class java.lang. Java strings are created and manipulated
through the string class. Once created, a string is immutable.
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder
simultaneously.

What is Singleton class?
n object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class)
at a time. Which mean can be only used once.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
When the object won't be serialized during serialization.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
a while loop and do while loop is that while loop check condition before iteration of the loop, whereas do-while loop,
checks the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop

What is Enum?
Enum is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type.

What is Iterator?
An iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
int = Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructors in Java. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with
respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one garbage collector thread for the garbage collector
operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple garbage collection threads for the garbage collection operation.


What is JIT stands for?
Just I =n Time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Garbage collection is the process of freeing space in the heap or the nursery for allocation of new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the
names of the classes, methods and it is useful because it supports dynamic retrieval of information about classes and
data structures by name, and allows for their manipulation within an executing Java program.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are
 used to achieve multitasking.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads in Java.

What is Framework?
Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of prewritten code to which you add your own code to solve a problem
in a specific domain.


What are the testing Framework available in java?
Unit, Mockito, JwebUnit, HTMLUnit, Arquillian, JWalk, TagUnit, TestNG


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG supports parallel testing, while JUnit does not have such a feature.
