Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.to store and retrieve data.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Insertion:  addition of a new data element in a data structure.
Deletion:  removal of a data element from a data structure if it is found.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design,
Operating System,
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis,
Graphics,
Artificial Intelligence,
Simulation.

what is an Array?
array, in the context of Java, is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of
values of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.

what is LinkedList?
 linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list
relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.


what is queue?
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

what is stack?
A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is an acronym for first in, first out, a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer while FIFO's opposite
is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or 'top of the stack' is processed first.

what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
 when array is already sorted

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
when it is unsorted

what is tree in data structure?
 A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap and Hashtable store key/value pairs in a hash table. When using a Hashtable or HashMap, we specify an object
that is used as a key, and the value that you want linked to that key.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in
 constant time  provided the key.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
It occurs when an attempt to use an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the array
causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
1. Manually
2. Arrays.copyOf()
3. System.arraycopy()
4. Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list
relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.

What is DFS and BFS?
The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing and
searching a node in a graph. They can also be used to find out whether a node is reachable from a given node or not.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is method calls itself to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear Data Structures are organized sequentially or linearly where data
elements attached one after another is called linear data structure.

Non Linear Data Structures are not organized sequentially is called non linear data structure.



What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.


Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Heap Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Bucket Sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
